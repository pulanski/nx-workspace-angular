<!-- ABOUT THE MONOREPO -->
## About The Monorepo

<!-- [Monorepo Screen Shot] is done in VSCode
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)  -->

This monorepo serves as a single source of truth for all of the dependencies required by the apps/projects I'm currently working on building. It is designed primarily with scale and best-practices in mind such that the codebase progresses cleanly and maintains both high code quality and maintainability over time. This means that if and when I want to take a step back from working on a particular project (to work on another or take a break in general), I can do so and have the ability to come back later and easily start where I left off. In a way, this approach follows the core idea behind writing software with Java back in the day (i.e. write once, run anywhere).

Following the core philosophy behind Nx, the apps themselves are extremely lightweight shells, with the vast majority of functionality abstracted into libraries in an attempt to promote code sharing and reuse between applications at any scale.

This monorepo promotes these principles:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

As a general note:
* Any JS/TS developer knows the problems you encounter when you're working on multiple projects at the same time. As time goes on and the number of projects/apps you start to work on begins to grow (whether that be for learning purposes or for prototyping/production), your disk space will become more and more clogged down by various node_modules each with their unique set of dependencies. This setup eliminates that problem entirely, which is especially important for working on machines in which you are limited in storage space. It also allows you to manage the dependencies your projects rely on in one location. While this may sound intimidating at first, it is important to note that this approach has been shown to work at Google, which is said to have a monorepo containing 100s of various apps the company is currently working on.

If you're interested in demoing the apps housed within this monorepo, head over to the Getting Started section found below.

### Built With

This monorepo contains full-stack web and mobile apps built with the following frameworks/libraries/technologies.

Frontend
* [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)

Backend
* [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

ORM
* [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)

Database
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Developer/Design Tools

Within the monorepo is a first class suite of various tools utilized to promote Test Driven Development and to create a consistent Design System. Each of these tools, expose APIs which, in my opinion, are intuitive, simple-to-use and make the resting and design portions behind software development both easy and even  fun to do.

Unit Testing
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

End-to-End Testing
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

Design System
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can get started by cloning this repo, which can be done via the <a href="https://cli.github.com/"> GitHub CLI </a> using the following shell command.
  ```sh
  gh repo clone pulanski/nx-workspace
  ```

As a note:
* The GitHub CLI is not required for cloning the project, however it is a tool I came across a while back and have found to be useful in my experience with open-source software development and one I see to be handy for any software developer. If you don't already have the GitHub CLI, it can be installed to your machine locally via your OS's package manager. Examples are shown below.
	* Mac/Homebrew
  ```sh
  brew install gh
  ```
  	* Arch/Manjaro
  ```sh
  yay -S gh
  ```
  
With the repository cloned to your local machine, you can demo any of the projects found inside the apps directory in the root of the monorepo. Each of these have an associated README included to help you better understand everything that's going on with that part of the stack.

### Prerequisites

Before you can begin working within the monorepo, it's important that you have the  you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"> NodeJS </a> installed on your machine. With NodeJS installed, and the repo successfully cloned, you can then use the following shell command to install all of the necessary dependencies of projects housed within the repo via the <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> package manager.
  ```sh
  yarn
  ```
 As a note:
* Yarn is not required by any means in the development process. There are various JavaScript package managers currently available to JS/TS developers, most notably <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>, and <a href="https://pnpm.io/">pNPM</a> to name a few. However, I tend to go with Yarn as it provides these features out of the box.
	-   ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Emojis
	-   [Speed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/compare)  üèÉ‚åÅ
	-   Automatic shrinkwrap with the yarn lockfile
	-   Security-centric design

<!-- ### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
